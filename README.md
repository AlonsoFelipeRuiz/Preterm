Dream challenge Preterm-birth

Here is the jupyter notebook with the code performed for building the trees and the four models generated. Random forest models for preterm are compressed as zip files because they were too large. Training the models takes less than a minute, you can retry in your computer.

Predictive model using Random Forest and preparation for production using Docker. The project took part in the Microbiome DREAM Challenge, obtaining the place 17th.
