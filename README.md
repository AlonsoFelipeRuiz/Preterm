# Preterm
Dream challenge Preterm-birth

Here is the jupyter notebook with the code performed for building the trees and the four models generated.

**Things to do**
We need to train again with the same parameters the model but now using all the data (train and test), we already evaluted the performance and selected the parameters, training with all the data (30% more) the final model I spect can improve to >0,85 AUC.
We will need also to generate the docker and python scripts to use the model for predicition of the datasets they have.
