# Preterm
Dream challenge Preterm-birth

Here is the jupyter notebook with the code performed for building the trees and the four models generated. Random forest models for preterm are compressed as zip files because they were too large. Training the models takes less than a minute, you can retry in your computer.

**Things to do**

We will need also to generate the docker and python scripts to use the model for predicition of the datasets they have.

**Things I already tryed**

Fine tunning of parameters, knn models, neural netowrks and 1D convolutional networks, decision trees and logistic regression.
